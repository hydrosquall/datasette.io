Datasette templates can be used to build custom websites with Datasette under the hood. Examples include the site you are browsing right now.

## [datasette.io](https://datasette.io/)

The official Datasette website runs on top of Datasette. Browse [github.com/simonw/datasette.io](https://github.com/simonw/datasette.io) to see how it works.

## [Niche Museums](https://www.niche-museums.com/)

[www.niche-museums.com](https://www.niche-museums.com/) is a directory of small and niche museums, powered by Datasette. Read [niche-museums.com, powered by Datasette](https://simonwillison.net/2019/Nov/25/niche-museums/) for details, or browse [the code](https://github.com/simonw/museums) on GitHub.
